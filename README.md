#Big Then Median 
This program is about median number.
By givin two sorted array we need to find the median number in two arrays
then insert all numbers greater than the median to the new array.
There is two programs the first use Algorithm to find the median number
and run single thread for every value.
The second is with out any Algorithm. just simple program to sort both array
and compare every value to find the median.
after the program fished running it will print the time it taken,

#Numbers Game
By givin array with integer numbers 1-100
two players choose number one by one from the left side of the array
or the right side of the array.
the winner is those who reach a high sum of numbers.
This class has two programs and GUI  Graphics that show players condtion in avery round
the first program is  computer vs student using algorithm
the computer calculate every round odd index values and even index values
then choose the best option to win the game.
the second program is student vs student without algorithm.

##Numbers Game options
1) Computer vs Student : computer choose first and win the game.
2) Student vs Student : random selection without algorithm.
